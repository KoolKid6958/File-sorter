The code comprises three distinct functionalities:

- Sort Files:
This feature organizes files based on specified criteria such as creation date or modified date. Users have the flexibility to sort files by year, month, day, or time. Upon sorting, the files are relocated to a destination directory provided by the user.

- List Files:
The list files functionality allows users to generate a list of files within a specified folder. Users have the option to sort the file list alphabetically, with or without commas separating the file names. Additionally, users can choose whether to include the directory path of each file in the list.

- Compare Folders:
This feature facilitates the comparison of two folders, identifying any discrepancies in the file contents between them. If there are any differing files, they are listed for the user's reference.

### It's simple and easy to use. just start it.
